        twistit - Handy tools for the twisted framework
        =============================================================
        
        `twistit` is a collection of utilites for `twisted` that I've found
        handy but too small to justify a dedicated project for each. 
        
        This library is open source and released under the MIT License.
        
        You can install it with `pip install twistit`. It doesn't need to
        compile anything, so there shouldn't be any surprises. Even on Windows.
